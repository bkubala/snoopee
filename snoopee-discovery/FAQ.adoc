= Frequently Asked Questions about SnoopEE

## Is SnoopEE a Load Balancer?
*No*, the intention of SnoopEE is to provide a service registration and lookup
mechanism. If you are running multiple instances of a microservice, this should
be load balanced using any load balancer tool and it is the _load balancer's IP/hostname_
that is registered with SnoopEE Service using the SnoopEE configuration parameters.
